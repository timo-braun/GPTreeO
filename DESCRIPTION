Description: We implement and extend the Dividing Local Gaussian Process 
    algorithm by Lederer et al. (2020) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2006.09446>. Its
    main use case is in online learning where it is used to train a network of
    local GPs (referred to as tree) by cleverly partitioning the input space. 
    In contrast to a single GP, 'GPTreeO' is able to deal with larger amounts of
    data. The package includes methods to create the tree and set its
    parameter, incorporating data points from a data stream as well as making
    joint predictions based on all relevant local GPs.
